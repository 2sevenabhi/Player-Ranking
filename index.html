<h1>Top Players Of All Time According to Abhishek Mishra</h1>
<h2>My Best 3 Players</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Virat Kohli</h3>
<p>A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008.
     In an Indian team filled with saint-like
     icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.</p>

<h3>MS DHONI</h3>
<p>Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through television 
    sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school CRT television at a local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator
     in Ranchi awaited the birth of his third child.</p>

<h3>Sachin Tendulkar</h3>
<p>You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard the chant. 
    The chant - one that a billion people once lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede and echo across the city and the seas. It is a name that continues to inspire many, not only in India, but all over the world, to take up the sport.
     Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was that cricketer whose personality and aura upstaged any cricketing contest; yet he maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game.</p>
